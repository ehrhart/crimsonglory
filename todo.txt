----------------------------------LOG----------------------------------
\\ - change the entities create delete dependent on WORLD.
// - make common classes for vehicles, chars etc. so no code repeats if possible
/ - make Man class derived from CCharacter [is CSoldier now]
// - make entities spawnable from one universal script command
// - setmaterial nocollisionId for attached entities
// * character with no control crashes
// - fix and make the attachment system really work (for magazines -> weapons -> people -> machines)
// ! use DeleD for making terrain components for maps
// - script loads everything into complete map
// * flickering
// * character loses model after reaching bound of circa 149 points
- culling for characters and effects
- make verlet integrator timestep sensitive
* newton nodes have no bad vertex color dispaying (they show up after dmf mesh is loaded)
// * weapons seem to drift in Z direction
// * isHoldingWeapon doesn't work
// * weapon sometimes disappears when picked up (sth to do with transformMatrix)
// - make base class for effects
* position of character is affected by speed of plane
* bInWater is confused on create, so there are imaginary splashes in water
// - make hydroplane derived from more generic CMachine
// - make weapon derived from generic pickable thing class
// - make factory for effects
\\ - make sceneries factory (clouds etc.)
** convex hull creator crashes on some cut meshes
/ - collision for both hydroplanes when hit
** random crash on (!Device.run()), after shot, after dropping and picking flag and weapon
// * hydroplane does wrong flip sometimes and messes up controls
// * weapon shoots through level collision
- optimization: Newton collision is called a lot in one frame, optimize PhysicsCollision()
* weapon shoots through hydroplane at some points
// - precaching of textures and sounds [done by libraries]
\\ - sound loading manager
// - character and machine damage system (bZombie = true in Think() when health drops)
// - character crouching (convexhullmodifier)
- move critical algorithm procedures to executable
\ - function to check if key was pressed in last tick (key released)
// - change this to be loaded instead of const if (fSpeed > (fMass / 17.0f) )
// - buoyancy doesn't work for character (Newton bug)
// - manage lights in map
\ - texture filename should be passed for effect
// - home, end keys in console
- hydroplane should have a little engine startup time
// - add system for sound variations
/ * you can shoot yourself if shooting up on ground
// - make tick velocity constant
\\ * sound is play for tick before volume clamped
// - store last hit owner for points record when character dies
// * soldier gets stuck in horizontal wall if running at it and turning
// * items fall through level (Newton collision bug, make sizable hull modifer when it works with buoyancy) [using continous collision]
* Irrlicht in fullscreen works slow with Konnekt
- try to make WorldTask in game exe
- working wave respawn
// - working respawn points
// - create rules and make respawn time variables
// - console scrolling (page up, page down)
- localplayers with different ports
// - the player actor should be created in rules class
// - make players stats in resizable array instead of struct
* autoconfig settings are set to default after crash or when localplayer joins?
// - hydroplane LoadAttachment from config, how in network?
- optimize: factory string name is sent through network
// - make character loaded from cache not from disk
- actor cloning
// - make respawn change respawn point if collision is there
- soldier context menu scripted
- server should send all actors used at start to client, then the client clones them
// - in APP.useFile() change "\" to "/", also make somekind of callback for client when file not found?
// * many soldiers can mount one plane, do seat occupation check
// * camera has problems after reaching some map distance [CCamera::Think() getLengthSQ() < 10000000000.0f might cause more problems]
// - make rules responsible for modifying damage
* bot crashed with plane at high speed and everything got slow
// - loadattachment must be somewhere else than in Unserialize
// - add all map scripts to DeleD
// - addzone is not working in DeleD
// - think of a way to distinguish server role and client on loopback connection (NET.rakServer->IsActive())
// - make rules attachments in respawn points
- chat addressing (to team, to all, ...)
// - file checking on join - check file extension, only media files go in [needs precaching for server to work correctly]
// * there is a compiler crash when disconnecting a player
- make network testing easy
/ * file verifier works randomly (a specific file is either good or bad)
// - chat name strings created in a client and server function
* chat console gets broken if first string is broken into pieces more than size of console
* delete controls crashes
- Optimize: Irrlicht arrays are slow, use static ones if large and used often
// * crash on loopback or join in compiler [I left a commented zone after debugging, stupid me]
* firing sometimes slows down game when fired to infinity
// * dropping weapon mid-air destroys plane
- soldier class texture change
- make global camera target distance for all LOD calculations
* propeller gets dislocated on higher speeds
- particle affecting fields (wind)
- Optimize: effects rendering out of camera
\\* if sound is off FPS gets synched (freeSL takes 25% CPU)
// - convert to FreeSL 2
// - add sound system option
- mesh slicing precached or other optimization
// - make plane simulation as accurate to make air tricks
- make world size limited to map not constant
- music loops on first song
//- add angle of attack and tail force (will not be adding angle of attack)
//- fix CAnimSprite ghost flash on load [absolutetransformupdate)
* billboard rendering flipped vertically
- less far value for camera under water (so far clouds are not visible)
//- find a way to determine if plane is whole in water and make wake dissapear
** "device.run()" crash while shooting with rifle at character; throwing planegun around rifle
* plane sometimes dissapears when hit hard with other plane or bullet
* games slows down on intensive collisions
\- change to 2d joint
- some way of limiting number of particles appearing
- shadows
** crash on loopback on test6 map
- support unicode
