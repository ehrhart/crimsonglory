<b>Core Game Play:</b> <br>

Crimson Glory is a multiplayer game at its essence. It revolves around
the idea of two opposing teams, the Air Force and the Air Pirates which
struggle to dominate over the Mediterranean to aquire prosperous
resources. There is no good or bad, both teams have the same
motivation, to win by either killing all enemies or conquering the map.
<br>

<br>

<b>Classes:</b> <br>

Characters: <br>

* infantry - basic class; can use and operate guns and ground
machinery; can hold multiple weapons and equipment <br>

* pilot - holds only secondary weapon like a revolver; pilots are more
casual (for example wear jackets instead of uniforms) <br>

<br>

Hydroplanes:<br>

- scout -&nbsp;fast little plane, used mainly for capturing the
enemies flag;
1 seat<br>

- fighter - standard fighting plane; 1 seat <br>

- bomber - heavy plane that can transport bombs or people; has place
for people to sit inside; 2 seats for pilot and machinegunner<br>

<br>

<br>

<b>Game Play Elements:</b> <br>

Two gameplay modes:<br>

- dogfight, like teammatch in other games <br>

- capture the flag <br>

- conquest - fight for map control points <br>

<br>

<b>Technical Details:</b> <br>

Default resolution for the game is 1024 x 768. This can be changed but
the GUI elements need to be created with this resolution in mind. Also
all except background images should fit in the minimal resolution 640 x
480. <br>

- 3D models can be stored in any popular format (.obj, .3ds, .lwo,
.ms3d) <br>

- textures can be stored as .bmp, .jpg, .png <br>

- 2D sprites are stored in .bmp files; all animations are stored in one
file; the color key is pixel (0,0) <br>

- 2D sprites for effects like fire use add-color technique while
rendering, so the more dark on the image the more transparent in the
game <br>

- characters use Cal3D format for all (mesh, material, bones and other)
<br>

<br>

<b>Overall Goals:</b> <br>

This is an alternative version of history that happened after World War
I which ended with a different scenario than what happened in our
history. Who won that war is not important. Because of the
characteristic terrain of the Mediterranean and the specific time (the
rise of the flight-age) hydroplane fighter planes are used mostly in
combat. All machinery and weapons in this game remind us of ours but
their look evolved slightly differently. Technology is not advanced but
the materials from World War I provide excellent resources for weapon
construction for both teams. The Air Force is funded from the army so
their machinery is slightly more polished and formal than the Pirates
which are more individual.<br>

The 3D models are low-poly. Because of this and the camera angle
placement texture quality is very important (per-pixel detail). 2D
graphics for particle effects use animated sprites and/or modern 3D
engine effects for image manipulation. <br>

<b>Marketing:</b> <br>

TODO:<br>

<br>

<b>GUI:</b> <br>

* Scoreboard and team selection graphics - a flag or logo for both
teams. <br>

* Painted image presenting a scene from the game - used as background
for menus, console or loading screens. <br>

<b>Other:</b> <br>

* Propeller animation: (1 file, frame size 32x32)<br>

- slow motion<br>

- fast motion<br>

<b>Game Play Elements:</b> <br>

<br>

* Character<br>

- <a href="http://cal3d.sourceforge.net/modeling/tutorial.html">tutorial
for Cal3D</a>, the part about exporting materials is worth
reading <br>

- bone animations are independent, for example animation of holding a
weapon uses only bones involving arms, head, spine etc.; animation of
running stores only bones for legs <br>

- the rendering of Cal3D is quite slow, so the less polygons the better
<br>

- the character will be rarely seen from close, so the highest detail
for bones is feet, palms, no fingers. <br>

- both teams use the same model, only textures change or accessory (you
can attach new models in Cal3D, like hats) <br>

<br>

<i>[animations need consultation because I don't know yet how
they fully work]</i><br>

- lower body/leg animations: stand; run; run backwards; crouch; crouch
run; jump up; jump forward; falling <br>

- upper body animations: hold rifle; hold revolver; hold club/machette;
fire rifle; fire revolver; use club/machette; reload; rifle; reload
revolver <br>

- overall animations: sit in plane/car; stand and use Anti-Aircraft
gun; shot death animation; fall on ground death; explosion death <br>

<br>

* Hydroplane<br>

- planes use different models and textures for both teams<br>

- the hydroplane is dynamically destructible in the game and therefore
needs some optimizations from the modelling part:<br>

- it must have low vertice count &nbsp;(a test model with 3500
vertices works too slow)<br>

- each distinct part of the plane (tail, wing, engine) must use
different material (and texture)<br>

- the placement on the axis is important, point [0,0] is the center of
mass of the physics model (check the reference model below to see how
it looks)<br>

<br>

<br>

* Weapons<br>

- standard army rifle; standard pirate rifle (attached bayonnete)<br>

- revolver <br>

- pirate club; army machette <br>

- plane machineguns (are used on planes but can be also picked up and
used by soldier; they are the same for both teams): <br>

scout plane little gun; fighter plane gun; bomber mounted gun <br>

- plane bomb <br>
